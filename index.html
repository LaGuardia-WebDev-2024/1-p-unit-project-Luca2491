  My Camera
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are <font size="+2">two</font> main parts to a DSLR camera. <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The <font size="+2"><strong>body</strong></font></li>
          This part of the camera is what holds the image sensor, the viewfinder, and the screen to view your images. It is what actually takes the photo. 
          <li>The <font size="+2"><strong>lens</strong></font></li>
          Without the lens it is impossible to take a clear photo. It is what directs the light from outside directly onto the sensor.<br>
          </p>
      There are many different types of lenses.
          <ul>
            <li>a zoom lens</li>
            <li>a prime lens</li><br>
            The main
            <li>a macro lens</li>
            <li>a wide angle lens</li>
            <li>a telephoto lens</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
