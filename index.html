        <ul>
          <h2>
            <u>The Body</u></h2>
          This part of the camera is what holds the image sensor, the viewfinder, and the screen to view your images. there are two different types of cameras. a <em>mirrorless</em> camera and a <em>DSLR</em> camera.
          </p>
      <p>

          <h2>
            <u>The Lens</u>
  </h2>
          Without the lens it is impossible to take a clear photo. It is what directs the light from outside directly onto the sensor.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      There are many different types of lenses. the two main categories are:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>zoom</strong> lens:</li>
            a zoom lens is able to zoom in and out. this is called the focal distance and it is measured in millimeters. For example, a very common lens new photographers will buy is a 24-70mm lens. 24 being the widest field of view it can go and 70 being the narrowest. it is wide enough for landscapes and can zoom in far enough for portraits or wildlife photography.
            </p>

            <li><strong>prime</strong> lens</li>
            a prime lens only has one focal distance. the reason someone might choose a prime over a zoom lens is because they typically have better image quality. another reason to buy a prime lens over a zoom lens is for a lower aperture at an affordable price. 
      </ul>
